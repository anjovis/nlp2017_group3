I have called several dealers and dumps in Holland and England but they all told me it's hard to find a hard top for these vehicles.
Do you or any LRO reader, know where I can find the right hard top? [/p] [p]
The roof for a 107 station wagon is rare in Britain.
It is also unique, so a later top cannot be used as it is six inches narrower than the Series One.
It is possible to cut a more readily available 86/88 inch Series One roof and fit a new piece of aluminium to the middle to make up the difference, but this is not really a perfect solution. [/p] [p]

Augmentations are worth searching out, for there is many a manor, grand house, or estate which has at one time been owned by an eminent person in receipt of an augmentation of one kind or another &mdash; and there is almost certainly a good tale to tell. [/p] [/div2] [div2] [head]
Helms and supporters [/head] [p]
The style of helm and the direction in which it faces, whether it is open or closed, are [pb] all important pointers to the status of the person whose armorial bearings are being depicted.
The subject is dealt with cogently and succinctly in the [hi]New Dictionary of Heraldry [/hi], and in even terser form the present practice may be stated as follows: a peer's helm is shown as a stylised silver m&ecirc;l&eacute;e type, facing dexter (that is [hi]left [/hi] to the observer) and decorated with gold <head>bars</head> ; the helmets of baronets and knights face the front ( [hi]affronty) [/hi] and are of the steel &bquo;barrier&equo; variety, with visors raised; esquires, gentlemen (and corporations) display closed &bquo;tilting&equo; helms of steel, facing dexter.

To complete my review of the soft ware, this month's article explores the facilities provided by the program for the creation and manipulation of colour patterns. [/p] [p]
The three options on the main menu that are directly related to colour pattern designing are COLOUR, INTEGRATE AND LINK. [/p] [div2] [head]
COLOUR [/head] [p]
Selecting COLOUR from the DesignaKnit main menu will take you into the stitch pattern designing section of the program.
The colour pattern menu will be displayed along the top of the screen and at the bottom of the screen will be a blank stitch proportioned grid. [/p] [p]
There are eight options on the colour pattern menu and, as with the shaping section, selecting any of these will usually lead to a sub menu.
Selecting from the menu can be done in the usual way, by moving the highlight <head>bar</head> with the arrow keys (or mouse) and then pressing the ENTER key to make your selection.

The main point of interest here is the bends in bar 2 which follow the 4ths in bar 1.
These involve bending the b5&ndash;5 and the 6-&flat;7, therefore implying an A7 chord sound.
Be very careful to pitch these bends correctly &mdash; they will sound awful if they are inaccurate. [/p] [p]
Fig 3 is the intro to [hi]Pride And Joy [/hi].
The main rhythm part of this example is very similar to the walking bass idea that we saw in fig 2 of last month's article.
So the same guidelines apply: pick the bass notes hard and the top notes a little softer to give the impression of two independent parts being played simultaneously.
Also, the turnaround found in <head>bars</head> 13&ndash;16 is a little tricky so, if you have any problems, break it down into small parts and practise it slowly, only building up the speed when you're feeling more comfortable. [/p] [p]

As Dorothy Wade found out, most experts believe that childhood mistakes are an important part of growing up [/head] [head]
By DOROTHY WADE [/head] [p]
PARENTS' disapproval of their child's friends can begin at a surprisingly young age.
When Jonathan, aged three, the son of professional parents, went to a respectable church nursery school he quickly became firm friends with a rowdy boy called Jason, who had a broad Cockney accent and a permanently dripping nose. [/p] [p]
&bquo;I knew I was just being snooty,&equo; says his mother in some embarrassment, &bquo;but I wondered why Jonathan was attracted to the child with the most disadvantaged background.
We went to Jason's birthday party and the kids sat and ate mountains of gooey cake, chocolate <head>bars</head> and ice-cream for about two hours while all the adults smoked over them.

Out of some sort of desperation she seemed to want to degrade herself.
She usually left with one of the men.
Afterwards she would be full of remorse and would return to playing the clean-living model student.
Katrine wanted to help her.
That was why once or twice Debbie let her cash the money order for her.

Other property opportunities will open up when the Russian &mdash; and eventually the American, British and French &mdash; military finally vacate their extensive bases (the British are said to occupy some particularly fine pieces of real estate).
Already the collapse of the old East German regime has resulted in some unlikely new uses for former government property.
In Wandlitz, just north of the city, the 140 hectare villa complex until recently known as &bquo;Volvograd&equo;, home to politburo members of the Honecker regime, is to be turned into sanatorium to serve Berlin and the surrounding area. [/p] [p]

In late Visean, a displacement of the basin towards the north took place. [/p] [p]
During Namurian time the main influx of material came from the &bquo;Old-Red Continent&equo;, the Fenno-Scandian Shield in the north-east.
To a lesser extent material was supplied from the south.
Confirmation is found in the increase of coarser sands and number of conglomeratic intervals towards the south within the alluvial fans. [/p] [p]
The Westphalian age is characterised by alternating conglomerates, sands, silts and claystones in very distinct cycles of transgressive and regressive phases.
There was deposition in large alluvial fans stretching out from the mountains in the south and the north-east into the flat plain.

In short, theology is no longer simply taken for granted or even accepted by society at large.
This is a situation of which modern theologians have been well aware &mdash; often too much so for the comfort of many in the churches &mdash; and with which they have tried in various ways to deal. [/p] [p]
Within that wider development, the credibility of Christian faith itself first came to be seriously challenged in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries &mdash; in what is commonly called the [hi]Age of Reason [/hi] or the [hi]Enlightenment [/hi].
The chief mark of that period was a new confidence in the power of reason, as opposed to acceptance of authority, to discover truth: we find things out, not simply by believing what someone else tells us, but by considering the evidence, reflecting upon it, and accepting what can &bquo;prove itself at the <head>bar</head> of reason&equo;.

He did not have a headache although he listened to his old albums at full volume.
He did not have indigestion although he ate ready salted crisps with his whisky.

The next night he remembered to pick up a video on the way back from work.
He sat upright on the sofa and watched the whole film.

John has been brought to the bar, &bquo;a paradise for bachelors&equo;, by his randy friend Ernest (played by Dustin's real friend Stanley Beck).
She goes back to his four-room bachelor apartment at 52 Riverside Drive.
They go to bed as strangers and then spend the weekend alternately insulting each other and making up, trying to find out if they are fond of each other.
We learn with them that he designs furniture (as Harry Hoffman did) and she works in a gallery of primitive art on Madison Avenue, but only in the end do they reveal their names to each other.
When they first meet at the bar, he says to her, &bquo;What did you say your name was?&equo; 'I didn't say.
What's yours?&equo;
But they are interrupted and they do not bother to ask the question again during the whole weekend.
Obviously, unlike the <head>bar</head> in TV's [hi]Cheers [/hi], Maxwell's Plum was not a place &bquo;where everybody knows your name&equo;.

It was also a problem for David as well because he wasn't getting any gigs and he wasn't doing any recording work. [/p] [p]
One evening, David, Barry, Christina and John Hutchinson were all sitting in my front room and talking about what we could actually do to earn some money It was suggested that we might go down to one of the local pubs which held regular jazz nights, to see if they had an evening free and perhaps we could run a folk club just one evening a week and maybe charge people to come in and make a few pennies for ourselves. [/p] [p]
Having agreed that this was a good idea, David and I went down to a pub called The Three Tuns, which is in Beckenham High Street.
The landlord said that we could have the hall on Sunday evenings to run the club, and we could have it for nothing as he would make his money on increased <head>bar</head> sales.

If you're planning to build your own lean-to sun room or conservatory, it is essential to get the roof right.

One efficient method of covering the roof is to combine twin wall Lexon Thermoclear sheeting with Twinfix aluminium structural glazing bar.
So before launching out to buy materials, send for literature from each company.

So it was naturally with great affection and nostalgia that as an adult I laced up my boots on a damp October morning at the starting point in the station car park at Bridge of Orchy, in preparation to find out what really lurked at the top of Beinn Dorain.
I've always found the settlements on the A82 between Crianlarich and Glencoe most peculiar.
Crianlarich, Tyndrum and Bridge of Orchy are melancholy, stranded little hamlets that the internal combustion engine has mutated into service stations for coach parties and crumpled, travel-weary motorists.
A gift shop, a snack <head>bar</head> and a petrol station is not exactly a model, thriving Highland community, and the disquieting feeling that these places now exist only to empty the contents of your wallet if you so much as slow down is not a pleasant one.

Thus walls were often covered with, and the bar partitions made of, tongue-and-groove boarding, which was often grained.
Floors were frequently made from bare wooden boards or stone slab.
The exception was in the treatment of the bar itself, which was often treated as a decorative eyecatcher. [/p] [p]
This approach to design could formerly be seen in the Public Bar of the White Swan, Bradford Street, Deritend, Birmingham (owned by Allied's Ansells division).
This 1900 pub has a tongue-and-groove dado, about which the walls are covered with glazed tiles.
The focus of the design was the decorative bar and its back display area, whose strong lighting made it the centrepiece of the pub.
This concept has, however, been ruined by the introduction of a <head>bar</head> overhang with secondary lighting which obscure views of the back-bar display.

Retiring tenants sell their tenancy to a purchaser who must be approved by the company: applications are handled by Estates, usually by Mike Lester personally.
As is customary in the trade, tenants purchase all fixtures and fittings (including bar furnishings), initially from the company and subsequently from the outgoing tenant.
Goodwill is specifically excluded from the selling price (again, this is customary in the trade).
The price is invariably agreed on the basis of figures submitted by an independent licensed property valuer.
The price at which tenancies change hands is currently within the range &pound;115,000 to &pound;155,000. [/p] [p]
Tenants are required to purchase all liquor, soft drinks and <head>bar</head> items such as crisps and tobacco from Palatine, though at a discount, and they are expected to make their living from the profits after deduction of rent (paid to Palatine), wages, rates, lighting and heating, etc.

He'd use it to identify and locate all the landmarks which he had stared up at during his exhausting explorations, now seen from a very different perspective; he knew the names of all the streets where the distant, anonymous towers of the banks and finance companies were sited, having worn himself out many times by walking along them, fascinated by the scenes glimpsed behind their mirrored, darkened or tinted glass windows and walls.
Now he'd sit and stare at those same walls made transparent by all the lights left on at night.
From his local library he got photocopies of the maps of his district for 1811, 1843 and 1871; he'd sit there and try to work out how the changes in the maps related to the view at night; where the darkness of rookeries, courts and tenements had been replaced with the darkness of lampless parks and public gardens.

Mr Urbanec, who is to hold further talks with Mr Havel today &mdash; this time in front of television cameras &mdash; conceded that the party realised it was held in deep mistrust by the public, and accepted that henceforth it could only be part of the political spectrum. [/p] [p]
But Mr Urbanec pointed to hardline resistance to change within the party by revealing to the opposition that he had spent three hours seeking, apparently in vain, to persuade regional party barons that their &bquo;policy of power&equo; could not continue. [/p] [p]

Miss Roybal-Allard argues that a lawyer who is sleeping with a divorce client may not try too hard to reconcile husband and wife. [/p] [p]
The state bar would prefer to set a blanket rule governing all types of lawyers.
It has argued that a total ban on sex may be unnecessary; it would prefer to have rules that prevent a lawyer from bullying a client to have sex.
The Los Angeles bar &mdash; home to 26,000 lawyers &mdash; reckons that its existing rules, which &bquo;prohibit sexual relations with a client when such relations would impair the parties' decision-making abilities&equo;, are sufficient.
A total ban might also be opposed as an unconstitutional invasion of privacy. [/p] [p]
If the state <head>bar</head> decides against a complete ban, Miss Roybal-Allard may introduce a new bill requiring it to have one.

Whenever a program runs, then, a sequence of such translations between levels of language is set up, but, and here is an important point, no particular lower-level translation is necessary for the program to achieve its purposes.
Yet more importantly, the upper levels of the program have no access to the levels below them: the programmer who writes at the topmost, or accessible, level has no need to know how his program is being translated, even though for certain purposes he might wish to find out. [/p] [p]

Plotting the points on a scatterplot [/head] [p]
Plot each point carefully, using a symbol such as a cross; if more than one point lands on the same spot, you could plot the number of points represented (i.e. the numeral 2 if two points are superimposed).
Inspect the result and decide if it would look better if you stretched or shrunk the scale. [/p] [/div4] [div4] [head]

The code number is read into the computer, and then the text string for that number is read from the computer's data base.
Without this massive data base, all you read in from the bar code is a meaningless number. [/p] [p]
This is a good way of doing things in that it enables what is effectively a limitless number of different codes to be used, with as little or as much data as desired being attached to each code.
The data associated with each code number can be as small as the price such as &bquo;38p&equo;, or 100,000 words of text.
The upper limit on the amount of data is set by the database that has to handle it all, rather than by the car code system. [/p] [p]

Mr Cecil Parkinson rejected a demand from MPs on the transport select committee for immediate screening of passenger baggage on international flights, and instead promised &bquo;a progressive extension&equo; of screening. [/p] [p]
He has accepted 21 of the 28 recommendations made by the committee, but turned down demands for baggage hold examination and the introduction of a levy on fares to pay for better security. [/p] [p]
Mr Parkinson promised extra security inspectors at airports, some posing as terrorists to test security. [/p] [p]
Mr Prescott, who plans to table amendments to the airport security bill, said Mr Parkinson was paying lip service to screening and giving no indication when this would be achieved. [/p] [p]
&bquo;The major obstacle to achieving that goal is money,&equo; Mr Prescott said.
&bquo;Space is always available at airports for commercial operations such as shops and <head>bars</head> , but the authorities are not prepared to give up some space for security.&equo; [/p] [p]

Masking the displays down so that only the central 25x20&deg; area was visible abolished the effect of the differential perspective manipulations.
This result supports our speculation that the failure of Cumming [hi]et al. [/hi]

In contrast, the right-hand pair of <head>bars</head> show the average amount of perceived depth for the two simulated viewing distances in the &bquo;window&equo; condition in which the vertical and horizontal perspective cues were present only in the peripheral fronto-parallel regions and the central region containing the stereoscopic corrugations provided consistent perspective cues for the actual 57-cm viewing distance.

In Sheffield (Britain's fourth largest city) the only gay facility at the time was an upstairs bar in a pub called The King William.
To get to this bar you had to pass through a billiard room full of jeering straight men.
It amazed me to think that even though the gay bar had been situated up those dark stairs for many years, the straight men downstairs managed to keep up the impetus so that no queen should pass without an insult.
Indeed, the only people willing to endure this ordeal on a regular basis were the screaming queens who had already decided that the best way to cope was to flaunt it. [/p] [p]

It was decided to build a huge central market, the construction of which was entrusted to Baltard, a man who was as much an engineer as an architect, on a site which had existed since the reign of Napoleon I. Succeeding regimes had neither had the will nor the drive to carry out the project as originally planned, but the Emperor was determined that this new market should be one of the earliest major building projects of his reign.
He indicated to Haussmann that the form of the railway station, a huge open space covered by glass, had impressed him as a possible model and as a result of the Emperor's predilections, and Baltard's skill, the great new market of Les Halles was built in a light, airy combination of iron, stone and glass.
Its ten pavilions were to serve Paris for over a century and to take their place in the city's folklore.
From its inception, the new market was gas-lit, thus permitting night-time operations, so that the area became one of nocturnal rendez-vous &mdash; its caf&eacute;s and <head>bars</head> open when all else was closed.

Almost to a man, barristers fought the scheme.
Some of their arguments, such as that their professional standards were higher than could be maintained by law &mdash; as envisaged in the legislation &mdash; had a ring of truth to them.

They had a considerable army of former lawyers to call upon in parliament, and the comments of the former lord chancellor, Lord Hailsham, that the Government was &bquo;thinking with its bottom and sitting on its head&equo; caused a flurry or two.

There is no evidence that zinc metal was ever prepared in Africa &mdash; it has to be made by condensation since it volatilises before it can be reduced from the ore.
The technique was known in Europe in classical times but was forgotten.
It had to be rediscovered in the 18th century.
Brass made from metallic zinc was patented in England in [/p] [p]
1781 so Benin alloys exceeding 30 per cent of zinc must be later than this date. [/p] [p]
There is plenty of documentary evidence that brass objects were imported into Benin from Europe by sea and no one doubts that this was the main source of the metal from the 16th century onwards.
In earlier periods, some metal was traded across the Sahara Desert.
In 1964 at Ma'aden Ijafen, in southern Mauretania, Theodore Monod, then of the Institut Francais d'Afrique Novre, found 2085 brass <head>bars</head> abandoned by a camel caravan around the 12th or 13th century. [/p] [p]

Moreover, she had shown that, even if she was only regent and not queen, let alone king, she was, like the Stewart kings themselves, a formidable personality, all too able to impose her policies. [/p] [p]
The Frenchwoman who was the major politician of the 1550s was therefore deeply in tune with two centuries of Scottish political tradition.
Only in the last months of her life did it appear that her policy might not be sustained, because of the changed situation in England and France.
In that sense, she died a failure; but she died with the respect, even admiration, not just of her supporters, but of those Protestant lords who had struggled against her.
In the person of Mary of Guise, it had been made abundantly clear that neither a French background nor an assertive Protestant aristocracy was a <head>bar</head> to the exercise of power and the acquisition of respect.

Most recent models of 6mm collet routers now produce around twice the power of this model; this is not so much to speed the work, but more to improve the quality and variety of profiles made by cutters.

On the credit side, there is much for the parents as well as the teenagers to gain when the time comes for them to leave home.
The children learn to take responsibility for themselves.
However hard parents try to inculcate a sense of responsibility in their children, the habits of childhood die hard.
Most mothers haven't the heart to deny their children the care and comfort they have given them all their lives and many continue to run round them long after they are old enough to look after themselves.
In order to become a responsible adult, a young man or woman must learn the cost of living, in terms of hard cash and hard work.
While they are living at home, so many things are thrown in free.

This will change as you work, in the same way that colour 1 did, allowing you a large area of colour displayed for yarn matching. [/p] [p]
When you have completed colour 2, do the same for the remaining six colours in the palette.

Bring number 1 into the current colour box and once again use the FUNCTION menu to select ERASE DRAWINGS, making the screen the background colour 1. [/p] [p]
To keep this palette in memory, there is one further step we must take and that is to save the palette.

Derek had an aunt who lived not far from his new Scottish home.
Her birthday was on 21st December and he arranged a family dinner party to celebrate it.
His aunt, uncle, father and mother were present and it was held in a hotel.
At the close of the evening, he left slightly before the others to return home.
They saw him leave the room where they were sitting and begin to walk across a bar which lay between it and the entrance to the building.
A man intercepted him and began to say something.

Clarence also asserted that cultural and language differences could produce misunderstandings.

The lead-in note to bars 1, 3 and 5 (also 18, 20 and 22, which are identical to these) are lowered by the tremolo arm before you pick them, in order to achieve the &bquo;slide&equo; effect of a &bquo;trombone&equo;.
Picking the note and then letting go of the arm allows the note to rise in pitch, giving that requisite smooth gliss into the note.

Mr Moynihan should even now be pressing the football authorities to cast around for an island where The Problem can be contained.
One obvious candidate suggests itself: the island of Alcatraz.
Its qualifications for taming England supporters look from this distance more compelling than even Sardinia's.
It is smaller than Sardinia (just 22 acres, or roughly 13 football pitches, against Sardinia's 16,000 square miles, or six million pitches) which for purposes of containment ought to be counted pure gain.

I am not advocating such a theory of parsing English into formal representations &mdash; I happen not to believe strongly in such &bquo;top &mdash; down&equo; theories, though there are several relatively successful ones in the literature.
The point is that there could be such a command and at the level of that command where, as it were, the answer would be received, no information would ever be received about the other senses of &bquo;<head>bar</head> &equo; that the system as a whole might happen to know about in its dictionary, and the procedures for surveying that range of senses would never be revealed.

The function of the biceps is to bend the elbow, supinate the forearm and flex the shoulder.
As with the triceps, to develop larger biceps heavy basic exercises such as barbell curls or dumb-bell curls must be performed.
Dumb-bell curls should always involve rotation of the dumbbells.
This means that the biceps have been worked through their complete range of movement, aiding complete development. [/p] [p]
Forearm training is frequently omitted because of all the work the forearms do while training other body parts.
Higher repetitions must be used because the muscle type is denser and more resilient (like the calves).
Wrist rolling is probably one of the best exercises to perform.
This involves holding out a bar at arm's length and then rotating it.
A weight can be tied to the <head>bar</head> by a piece of rope and then raised and lowered to make the exercise more difficult. [/p] [p]

But Jaroslav Rona, a member of a group of prominent artists, says: &bquo;If intellectual groups had not met in the cafes, nothing would have happened.
If the authorities had had any sense, they would have closed the cafes.&equo; [/p] [p]
Prague's cafes have been the centre of cultural activity since the days of the Austro-Hungarian empire.
So potent is the tradition of Czech cafe society, that most cafes were shut down after the Communist takeover in 1948. [/p] [p]
To prevent opposition forces coalescing, the authorities went to great length to separate the various strands of artistic and intellectual thought. [/p] [p]
Separate organisations were created for, among others, officially approved painters, writers and architects, with each group being allocated an official meeting place.
Contact between the different groups was actively discouraged. [/p] [p]
Students were not even given their own campus cafe or union <head>bar</head> to meet in.

The town is a mixture of the old and the new.
Small back streets run higgledy-piggledy back up the hill from the golden, sandy beach and the main prom, and these contain a jumble of small bars, Spanish and seafood restaurants, Bodegas with wine barrels stretching from floor to ceiling, and wonderful shops selling leather, shoes and denim at remarkable prices. [/p] [p]
In a slightly more modern area of town, but still only a short stroll away from the beach, is Lloret's West End, built around the &bquo;Queen Vic&equo;, a traditional English style pub run by our good friend Jimmy.
It's open late, and has a massive outdoor cinema screen.
Right across the road from the &bquo;Vic&equo; is Rockafellas, the Club 18&ndash;30 disco <head>bar</head> , open well into the early hours and a host of other bars and discos such as the Texas and Moby Dick's.

The Vauxhall HPC Seven is so powerful that Caterham took the unusual step of offering a high performance driving course in the price of the car (between &pound;18,200 and &pound;23,000), compulsory for the under 25s. [/p] [p]
For the past few years, Caterham has produced a new model every year, whether it be with a different engine, or new suspension or an entire new series such as the Rover K-Series.
The annual models provide good publicity at the Motor Show, but surely there is a limit to what can be done to a car that has to be instantly recognisable by its shape?
&bquo;There is a limit to everything.
No doubt we will run out of ideas one day.&equo; [/p] [p]
Caterham does not have copyright on the Seven's basic, long-bodied shape, which ran out several years ago, but it has sued companies that indulge in &bquo;passing off&equo;.

The committee's findings were broadly in line with what the Law Society wanted, according to Mr Peter Ely, its president, although the committee's opposition to employed solicitors appearing in higher courts went against the society's wishes. [/p] [p]

This month I would like to continue our study of double stops by taking a look at some examples of their usage in blues playing.
The first example shown in fig 1 is a fairly typical intro idea, taken from the intro of Jimi Hendrix's [hi]Red House [/hi].
Bars 1&ndash;2 of this part rely on the intervals of thirds, sixths and flat fifths &mdash; or in other words the interval structure of the B7 and Bb7 dominant chord structures that are used.
This is then followed by some b7-root bends and a descending blues scale phrase.
Notice in this how the major 7th (A&sharp;) is used as a passing tone. [/p] [p]
Double-stops abound in nearly all aspects of blues playing.
The next example (fig 2) shows a 12 <head>bar</head> &bquo;walking bass&equo; rhythm part idea in which each bass note is followed by an open string double-stop.

Adjoining the churchyard is the Buttermarket, but only in name now.
The butter booths and the fire station have been removed but the local branch of the Heritage Society has restored the old town lock-up, known as the penny cells.
Men who were drunk at market were put in these cells till sober, and then had to pay a penny to get out.
There were two tiny windows, each with one bar across originally, but friends of the prisoners delayed the sobering up process by passing jugs of ale through the windows, so two bars were fitted.
Nothing daunted, the bearers of comfort brought a flagon of ale and a long clay pipe.

Niki is behind Johansson and he can't get past: Stefan's Toleman is faster on the straights and the track has few other places for overtaking.

The worksheets themselves are organized into Notebooks which contain 257 pages each (which should be enough for most mortals). [/p] [p]
Moving cells around the sheet is done by a similar drag &bquo;n&equo; drop process, but it's less well implemented than Excel's.
Single cells can't be moved with the mouse, and ranges which are in the process of being copied or moved look identical, so you're more likely to lose track of what you're doing. [pb] [/p] [p]
On the plus side, charting capabilities are excellent &mdash; there's a vast range of graph types.
There's also an enhancing tool which lets you embellish the charts and you can even paste bitmapped images (such as a picture of your favourite car) onto parts of the graphs.

Other savings will come from increasing the power of the reactor from 1200 to 1500 MW, the use of a smaller diameter reactor vessel, a rectangular rather than cylindrical reactor building, a thinner concrete structure, fewer pipes and the possible scrapping of the system to remove very hot items of equipment from the reactor vessel.

He also asserted that exact questions were n't replicated.  When referred
to the questions that matched, he said it was coincidental.  Mr. Kaminski,
the schoolteacher, and William Mehrens, a Michigan State University
education professor, concluded in a study last June that CAT test versions
of Scoring High and Learning Materials should n't be used in the classroom
because of their similarity to the actual test.  They devised a 69-point
scale -- awarding one point for each subskill measured on the CAT test --
to rate the closeness of test preparatives to the fifth-grade CAT.  Because
many of these subskills -- the symmetry of geometrical figures, metric
measurement of volume, or pie and <head>bar</head> graphs, for
example -- are only a small part of the total fifth-grade curriculum, Mr.
Kaminski says, the preparation kits would n't replicate too many, if their
real intent was general instruction or even general familiarization with

Judge Leval reluctantly concluded that a few of Mr. Miller's quotations
from Mr. Hubbard's unpublished writings, because they were not necessary to
prove historical points, failed the fair-use test and therefore infringed
copyright.  But the proper remedy, Judge Leval said, lay in a suit for
damages, not in an injunction.  The case went on appeal to the Second
Circuit.  In a decision in April of this year, Judge Roger Miner, joined by
Judge Frank Altimari, agreed on denying the injunction and did not doubt
that ``Bare-Faced Messiah'' was a serious work but rejected Judge Leval's
argument that the public interest in scholarship could outweigh the
sanctity of copyright.  ``We conclude,'' the two judges wrote, ``that

VOLUNTARISM: In an effort to stave off a plan that would require all

the state bar recommended an alternative program to increase voluntary

effectiveness before considering mandatory pro bono.  ``We believe our

achieve that objective without the divisiveness, distraction,

During a study of the various styles, it became apparent to me that if the back legs are set into the seat rails at an angle, this angle, together with the curvature of the rear legs and backward slope of the chair back can regulate the flair: if the legs are mounted at right angles to the rear seat rail, there would be no flair.
Increasing this angle increases the flair very sensitively, up to the maximum deflection of the curve of the rear leg, if it were to be (impractically!) mounted in the plane or the rear seat rail. [/p] [p]
The requirement for robustness also demands that there be leg braces to create a strong rectangle around the rear seat joint, the point of maximum strain in all chairs.
Anyone who has had to reglue chairs will be painfully aware of this fact.
A crossmember between these two braces helps; people frequently put their legs back under their chair seats, and a cross brace between the front legs would be in the way. [/p] [p]
The above design conclusions have profound implications for the construction details of my <head>chair</head> .

Here, the argument is presented that conceptual levels of understanding are necessary precursors to the emergence of spoken language, since language is, in effect, the linguistic realisation of those conceptual distinctions already established at a non-verbal level.
When conceptual distinctions are expressed in language they are referred to as [hi]semantic [pb] relations [/hi].
While emphasising the interdependence between semantic expres&rehy;sions and underlying cognitive concepts, this approach also implies that not all of a child's understanding of a particular experience may be expressed in language, and that a child may [hi]intend [/hi] to express more than she is actually able to encode formally in language structures.
For example, Chapter 1 discussed the ways in which researchers have introduced the notion of a &bquo;rich interpretation&equo; of utterances such as &bquo;sweater <head>chair</head> &equo;, &bquo;Daddy car&equo; in order to disambiguate alternative meanings. [/p] [p]

The Committee even considered the possibility that the occupant of the Chair be given a cut-off button or that other devices be employed to override demonstrations or disturbance in the galleries or on the floor of the House, but it rejected such innovations.
It did not want any kind of disorder to be filmed, including unparliamentary behaviour by Members (or even Members trying to attract attention by wearing fancy dress or clothes bearing slogans), and it therefore recommended that in all cases of disruption or disorder the director should cut to wide-angle shots, which would not show the offending incident, or to the occupant of the Chair.

To the Napoleonic era belong a &bquo;Portrait of General Suvarov&equo; carved in wood by Bonzanigo and a terracotta maquette by Canova for the portrait of Elisa Baciocchi Bonaparte in the guise of &bquo;The Muse Polymnia&equo;, now in Vienna (both exhibited by Antichi Maestri Pittori).
Of more recent origin is a &bquo;Via Crucis&equo; decorating a vase by Leonardo Bistolfi (Liberty &amp; Deco). [/p] [p]
The furniture section includes a few fifteenth-century pieces, including a small intarsia <head>chair</head> (Botticelli), and a painted cassone bearing the arms of the Strozzi-Sacrati family (Altomani).

He can move forwards, rolling the ball forwards, and then come back almost to sit on his heels.
When he has mastered this type of movement kneeling, more advanced work might involve sitting on his heels and then shifting his weight towards his hemiplegic side to practise controlling his arm and the side of his trunk while some of his bodyweight is transmitted from side to side. [/p] [p]
Kneeling can also be used to help the patient get up from the floor; most patients are taught to do this once they can walk, in case they have a fall.
If the patient can get into the kneeling position and then balance on one knee while bringing the other leg forward, so that he can lever himself onto a <head>chair</head> , he will feel confident that he can always get up, even if he is alone at home. [pb] [/p] [/div3] [div3] [head]

They were piled with corned-beef sandwiches, cheeses, sausage rolls, sliced pickled onions, beetroot, all kinds of pickles, watercress, pig's pudding and every mouthwatering delicacy you could think of.
And standing in the centre was a two-tiered, iced cake.
At one end of the table there were four stone gallon jars of ale, bottles of stout, gin and whisky.
There was room on the benches for twenty guests each side, facing each other.

The idea of entitlement probably represents an attempt, during a much longer debate about the need for a &bquo;national&equo; curriculum, to bring into focus the child's individual needs and rights: it is needed to counterbalance any propensity towards the state's collective needs &mdash; totalitarianism if you will &mdash; which a move towards a nationally prescribed curriculum might bring with it. [/p] [p]
Of course debate about the National Curriculum has been around a lot longer, but its popularisation and public debate is a relatively recent phenomenon.
It was a &bquo;secret garden&equo; at least to David Eccles who when Secretary of State for the second time, in 1962, was determined (against the better judgement of many of its guardians) to strip it of its secrecy.
Eccles' vehicle for clearing the garden's secrecy was the Schools Council &mdash; not a very efficient or fast-moving garden Rotavator.
When James Callaghan accelerated the debate in 1976, the quality of discussion was indeed raised, in what turned out to be the Schools Council's declining years, under the combined influence of the <head>Chair</head> , John Tomlinson, and the Secretary, John Mann.

[hi]Mind reading [/hi] At one of my first-ever children shows, the father told me of this mind reading trick which we found worked well with the children.
I left the room while the father remained as an article was chosen.
After it had been selected, I re-entered and told the audience to think about the article in question.
My partner [pb] then called out a number of articles and asked if they were the chosen one.
I said &bquo;NO&equo; to them all except the right one. [/p] [p]
The secret we used was to make the correct article immediately follow after one with four legs or corners.
So the correct article would follow a table, <head>chair</head> , the dog or cat or other relevant object in the room such as piano stool.

When planning your excursions in Madeira, let the morning sun be your guide in deciding whether you go east or west because it is quite common for one part of the island to bask in sunshine while another is cloudy.
The weather is one thing we cannot plan for as, although Madeira enjoys a good climate all year round, you must remember it is a small island in the Atlantic Ocean. [/p] [p]
Given the topography of Madeira, it is understandable that the island roads are full of twists and turns, climbing and descending all the time.
If you are hiring a car in the island, you will need three to four days to cover most of the main roads and to savour some of the breathtaking views.
There are various maps to show you the way, and we recommend you take a picnic with you, as most viewpoints also have picnic tables and <head>chairs</head> and space to pull your car off the road.

He was, with Giulio Argan who predeceased him by a month, and Federico Zeri, perhaps the leading opinion-former in the Italian art world, known to the general public from his articles in L'Espresso and then, from 1977, La Repubblica.
Trained by Roberto Longhi, he took part in the 1950s, together with Longhi and Argan, in the legation for the restitution of works of art removed to Germany during the war.
His academic career included the <head>Chair</head> in Contemporary art history at the University of Siena and his bibliography ranges from Mannerism to the Metaphysical painters and Guttuso.

The 1966 congress of the CPNI adopted a &bquo;Democratic Programme for Unity&equo;, which included demands for the electoral law in Northern Ireland to be brought into line with that in Britain, except for the reintroduction of proportional representation and the abolition of cash deposits by candidates. [/p] [p]
The CPNI was not instrumental in creating NICRA but it was well represented on its first executive committee: Noel Harris of AUEW TASS, a CPNI member, was the first chairman; Derek Peters of the CPNI was secretary; and Betty Sinclair of the Belfast trades council was elected to the committee.
At the meeting which adopted the constitution, Ken Banks of AUEW TASS was added to the executive committee; he was close to the CPNI, although not actually a member.
However, at the first annual general meeting in February 1968, Banks and Harris were not returned to the executive committee and although Sinclair replaced Harris in the <head>chair</head> , Peters was replaced as secretary by John McAnerney of the CSJ.

Mr Gorman recently trained to become a chiropractor. [/p] [p]
The basic principle of his chair is that the knees should be below the pelvis, a quite different principle to the design of most chairs.
The usual type of chair puts an enormous strain on the spine, back muscles and many of the internal organs.
Anyone sitting down for extensive periods (as we all had to do in our school days) would have to tense many of the body's muscles in order to sit up straight.
This, in turn, causes the organs, the bones and, ultimately, the entire system to be under stress. [pb] [/p] [p]
The forward-tilting chair allows the spine and the postural muscles to support and balance the body naturally.
You can easily see the effect by placing a telephone book under each of the rear legs of a ordinary kitchen <head>chair</head> .

The group had had numerous discussions about whether or not they should have a rotating chairperson, some people arguing fiercely that we shouldn't imitate male structures, that we were developing genuinely new ways of relating, conducting political discussions; we must all learn to be more sensitive, not interrupt each other, not talk for too long.
Everyone would nod.
Others in the group argued that up to a point all those things were right, but that often a subject was complex, often it could be constructive for everyone to have a chairperson who would guide discussion, not control it, who would be able to be supportive when someone talked too much or too little.
We should [pb] develop or modify existing structures as well as work out new ones.

The DHAC had proved that new and imaginative methods of protest could make an impact on the Unionist administration at the Guildhall, but for most opponents of the Unionist Party in Derry this was a reason for achieving a greater degree of anti-Unionist unity in order to press home their advantage, not to become equally [pb] hostile to the Nationalist Party.
This was shown by the first major DHAC protest following the 5 October 1968 demonstration, when the committee supported an NILP delegation to the council on the housing issue.
There was uproar when the council refused to hear the delegation and the meeting was adjourned, the Unionists withdrawing but the Nationalists remaining in their seats.
Eamonn Melaugh went over to the mayor's chair and sat down.
He shouted to the protesters: &bquo;I ask you citizens of Derry, do you approve of a crash programme of 2,000 houses?&equo;
There were cries of &bquo;yes&equo;.
They also approved his call for an extension of the boundary and he commented, &bquo;This is democracy.&equo;

My own taste for formal furniture tends to fall between the &bquo;Arts and Crafts&equo; and &bquo;Modern&equo;, rather than &bquo;Repro&equo;, and yet looking at modern designs you see in exhibitions, I doubt their &bquo;long-sit&equo; comfort and, personally, I feel that the limits of acceptable elegance are frequently passed by many, in the cause of being different.
The demand for elegance carries with it the requirement to fit in with existing furniture and although talking points can be useful, a table surrounded by a set of such chairs could be a positive eyesore.
Talking to professional designer-producers confirms this point: people will stop to admire such designs, but many more &bquo;traditional&equo; products are purchased. [/p] [p]
So we can put some limits on the project: the <head>chairs</head> must be upholstered; modern in the simplicity of their lines but not &bquo;Cubist&equo; for want of a better term; easy on the eye and bottom; they should fit in with other existing furniture; and naturally should be of strong construction so that they will be heirloom quality.

This needs to be placed at the angle which gives the best support for the material being used in relation to the pupil's vision, and some initial experimenting with different angles of work may be needed in order to settle on this.
A desk with an adjustable sloping top is useful as it provides storage space too, but probably the most practical aid, especially as the pupil progresses into secondary school, is a light, portable reading stand that can be easily taken from room to room as required.
It will need to have a ledge to support the reading material and strong clamps to hold pages in place are useful.
The earlier a pupil is able to find and keep to a comfortable and efficient working position, the better. [/p] [p]
Another factor in the pupil's near environment that can affect the comfortable use of vision for work is the &bquo;fit&equo; of the furniture (<head>chair</head> , desk, table) in terms of individual requirements.

In 1935 Ackroyd was put in charge of Entwhistle Halt on the Darwen-Bolton line.
There was nothing special about the halt: it had a signal cabin, about a dozen levers, and a pair of gates to allow carts to cross to the farms scattered across the moors.
Apart from the occasional passenger, the main traffic was milk chums en route to the dairy and dye wagons from Preston.
The sidings were situated about half a mile away and there was a water-tower nearby.
Ackroyd enjoyed a quiet bachelor life and lived in a small house by the crossing. [/p] [p]

This enabled him to look forward with confidence to continued improvements which would put the British plants back at the top of the performance league, where they used to be, and where they belonged. [/p] [p]

It is arguable that the increased visibility of gay men in television drama was a reflection of their dramatic potential as &bquo;dangerous&equo; characters, and their function in raising discussion of AIDS. [/p] [p]
Television's response to the struggle around Clause 28 reflected the status the campaign achieved in the political arena.
The involvement of influential people, including many heterosexuals, in all areas of public life; the high visibility of figures such as Ian McKellen and Michael Cashman; the size and nature of the demonstrations and direct actions made it great television material.
For probably the first time since 1967, homosexuality was at the forefront of public debate, resulting in moments of real visibility and intervention.
I recall one evening, during the early <head>days</head> of the campaign, when on three occasions on different channels (an arts programme and two awards ceremonies) public statements were made against the Clause.

Traditionally, these days were set apart for special prayer and fasting.
The following Sundays, for example Trinity Sunday, are the days specially fixed for the ordination of the clergy.
This ancient custom was finally established as a law of the Church, c.1085, by Pope Gregory VII. [/p] [p]

Tillard and Royal Marine Lt. R.C. Hay, spotted another Z.506B as they were heading back towards the carrier, and attacked.
This too made a number of very steep turns and made for nearby cloud, though its port engine was believed damaged, and possibly the rear gunner killed.
The Fulmars continued searching for it and came across it (or the aircraft forced down by Taylor) floating on the sea; there were no signs of life.

To stay with yellow for a moment: we noted a paring-down to the bare bones of yellow water in a yellow glass when Raskolnikov comes to after fainting on his first visit to the police station.
An opposite movement occurs with the elements of oppressive heat and smell on that same momentous fourth floor.
In the first draft of the scene neither are mentioned.
Then, as an afterthought, Dostoevsky wrote &bquo;the air was [pb] terribly stifling&equo; and &bquo;in addition, a smell of wet paint assailed the nostrils&equo;.
Our final text elaborates this to &bquo;the nauseating smell of fresh paint which had been mixed with rancid oil&equo;. [/p] [p]
Rancid oil is simply right.

Shelving covered the back two walls, whilst to the right was a biscuit stand containing some dozen tins, stacked at an angle so that by just taking off the lid, biscuits could be removed.
Jenkins did quite a delivery trade, the goods being taken out by Mr. Bevis on a very old &bquo;errand boy's&equo; bike with a wicker basket at the front.

They put up [hi]dazibao [/hi] which at first mostly mourned Chai, but the contents of the posters soon became more politically oriented.
The situation at Beida became tense as demonstrations were called to protest not just at the student's death but the poor conditions of intellectuals in China, the lack of free speech and human rights, excessive bureaucracy in the party's structure and rampant corruption within party echelons.
These issues were all becoming &bquo;hot topics&equo; of discussion and were later to form an integral part of the 1989 student movement.
The tragic death of Chai Qing Feng gave rise to small-scale protest which signalled clear warnings to the leadership of the serious problems they would have to face.

The household timetable revolves around restaurant work, with children often being late for school, and visitors being least welcome (and this is a very hospitable culture) early in the morning.
The notion of a routine, of a particular time for meals, baths, bed for young children &mdash; to fit in with the other interests and commitments of parents working outside the home &mdash; is not especially important.
If Bangladeshi mothers' idea of time emphasises fluidity and flexibility, then Welsh mothers' notions emphasise regularity and routine. [/p] [/div4] [div4] [head]

And yet, so mechanical is this learning routine that if we interrupt such a bee while she is feeding she must take off and land again of her own accord, that landing permits her to choose the correct feeder colour on her next visit.
Similarly, bees learn landmarks after taking off: a recruit who arrived and fed at the feeder, but was transported back to the hive while feeding, returned without the slightest memory of the landmarks she must certainly have seen on her arrival. [/p] [/div2] [div2] [head]
Desirable imperfection [/head] [p]
Other aspects of the associative component of flower learning seem equally curious.
Although a bee learns a flower's odour almost perfectly in one visit, she must make several trips to learn its colour with precision; and even then a bee never chooses the correct colour 100 per cent of the time.
It learns shape less quickly, and time of <head>day</head> more slowly still.

Accepting that meals are a very important part of a person's life-style means that their timing might have an important role in adjusting the body clock.
The effect can be direct, through the influence of food intake on gut activity (see below), or indirect, through the social factors that are associated with meals. [/p] [p]
Indigestion and constipation [/p] [p]
After eating the meal, the food must now be digested.
This requires the co-ordinated release into our gut of a series of digestive enzymes and fluids which are then mixed with the food.
The digested material is slowly passed through the gut by muscle action, and foodstuffs, water and salts are absorbed into our blood stream.
What remains is converted into solid material for elimination as faeces. [/p] [p]

This technique is more efficient when only sterile males are released, but we must be able to sort out the sexes.
At first entomologists depended on a slight difference in the size of the male and female pupae, but the technique was far from efficient.
Jack Seawright, a USDA colleague of Weidhaas, used a technique of genetic sexing.
This involved the translocation of the gene responsible for resistance to the carbamate insecticide propoxur on to the male-Y-chromosome so that only the males were resistant.
The exposure of immature insects to a dosage of the insecticide sufficient to kill the susceptible females, enabled Seawright to &bquo;mass produce&equo; more than one million sterile males a <head>day</head> with only two females per thousand.

The Treasury says the decision to change the basis of treatment, announced by Peter Lilley, Trade and Industry Secretary, on February 13, came too late to affect the current year's figures but have been included in the 1993&ndash;94 estimates. [/p] [p]
Pressure from Bruce Millan, EC regional commissioner, has resulted in the Treasury reluctantly accepting that the funds provided by Brussels are additional to government spending rather than part of it and should be steered to specific projects rather than forming part of the spending pool.
Treasury insistence that EC contributions are &bquo;taxpayers' money&equo; and should be counted as part of the public spending programme caused friction with the EC and Mr Millan froze money due to coal and steel areas. [/p] [/div1] [div1] [head]

I tried rearing owlets in my bedroom under heat lamps several times, usually without much success.
Come to think of it, I always seem to have baby owls in my bedroom.
Perhaps that's why it smells so terrible in there. [/p] [p]
One particular owl that sticks in my mind was one I kept alive for six weeks, in the early days.
He seemed to be doing fine and then one night I found him cold and dying.
I cuddled him for four hours until he died in my hands.
I was very upset, even though I had seen a lot of birds die before; I had really thought this one was going to make it.
I'm afraid this is just something you have to get used to, like a nurse in a hospital &mdash; it goes with the job.
Still, more make it these days, I'm glad to say.

The position will be a little clearer after the first of the two individual time trials around Luxembourg on Monday 13 July.
Team work now has no part in the outcome.

This race against the clock is of an intriguing length, 68 kilometres, perhaps a little too short for the top men in the discipline.
Noone can win the Tour without being able to ride a very good time trial.
But only a supreme effort over this distance will produce more than two or three minutes' advantage.
That's a lot of time on the flat stages, not so much on the fierce and extended mountain climbs that are to come. [/p] [p]

The war, seemingly interminable, was by now unpopular, and in October 1761, having failed to persuade his colleagues to declare war on Spain before she entered into an open alliance with France, Pitt the Elder resigned.
He was rapidly proved right; Spain pledged herself in December to a Family Compact with France, forcing England, on 2 January 1762, to declare war on her and reviving the old nightmare of a joint Franco-Spanish fleet sweeping up the Channel to land a papist army on English soil. [gap] [/p] [p]
The French invasion plan of 1762 was very different from all those that had preceded it.

Even on the same diet, this will vary from person to person depending on many individual factors, including the amount of excess weight (the heavier you are the faster you tend to shed weight) and the degree of energy expended in physical activity.
Nevertheless, there was a simple weight-loss equation on which it was possible to estimate the maximum amount of weight likely to be lost each week on any specific calorie allowance.
This was based on subtracting the calories consumed in food from the calories required to keep the body going. [/p] [p]
Let us assume that you are a woman of medium height, doing a job like housework, which requires a moderate amount of physical activity, and that you are about one stone overweight and just about to embark on trying to lose it.

The staff listed consists only of the chancellor, one of the greatest of the royal officers, whose wages were five shillings a day, the master of the writing-office, who originally had tenpence a day, but Robert de Sigillo had made himself so indispensable that he had risen into the two shilling class, and the chaplain in charge of the chapel and relics.
It is clear that Robert de Sigillo did not write all the royal writs himself, although there is no reason to believe that a twelfth-century English king needed a permanent staff of more than half a dozen clerks, sometimes perhaps even less.
The departments which fed the king and organized his armies, and above all his hunting staff, were far larger.
The household of Henry I of England, the most literate of its <head>day</head> north of the Alps and the Pyrenees, the centre of an administrative and judicial system which was rapidly growing, was still a mobile headquarters for a chieftain whose principal business was to hunt and to fight.

Yourcenar (an anagram on the family name of Crayencour) was not an academic, but as one of France's most highly-regarded novelists, she was the first woman to be elected to the French Academy.
Her best known novel, Memoirs of the Emperor Hadrian, is a work of scholarship and fiction, but, unlike the narratologists, she believed in the truth of history and the often melancholy tone of her writing lies in her regret that the dead have no more truthful memorial than that which the living can provide.
She would have especially wanted to know more of her own mother, whose story is told in the final chapters and who died in 1903 of peritonitis when the author was 10 <head>days</head> old. [/p] [p]

Briefly, the diet consists of an initial one or two day fruit &bquo;fast&equo;, followed by two weeks on raw fruits and vegetables, nuts, seeds, springwater, juices and herb teas.
Thereafter, you adopt a wholefood diet with a little or no dairy products and no more than one cup of coffee or two cups of tea a day.
I am afraid it is tough (at least at the beginning), as are all restricted diets, but I promise you, it does work!

In retrospect, perhaps we played on the heart-strings of our listeners too heavily, but it was, in actual fact, a hearty, healthy exercise in a good cause for the &bquo;benefit&equo; of the community, and in defiance of the written and spoken diatribes of a federal political bureaucracy. [/p] [p]
Thus it was that we made use of every method in the book to fan into flame the natural resentment of the public against a big and unfair bully kicking a man when he was down.

When John A. Droege came to write his classic work on the American station in 1916, he regarded train-sheds as beyond the pale: [quote] [p]
The day of the great awkward arched train shed is long since gone.
There was a time when in railroad terminal architecture it was considered as the most necessary adjunct (or evil).
It will long remain a problem to the average person that these sheds had such wide popularity and that so little use was made of the cheaper, cleaner, or, in fact, better umbrella sheds.
In view of the widespread use of the old style train sheds it is pleasing to our vanity to be reminded how expensive they were to build and how costly to maintain.
And what is more, the sheds are dark and dirty, the coldest places in town on cold <head>days</head> , the stuffiest on hot. [/p] [/quote] [/p] [p]

Given the clarity of your diagnosis, why then do you waffle when offering recommendations for reform?
You suggest continuous realignments, wider bands and &bquo;soft buffers&equo; (which in effect means no bands at all).
Back to floating is hardly what one expects to hear from The Economist, which understands the threat this poses to Europe's single market.
If Hoover's decision to move a couple of hundred jobs from Dijon to Scotland was enough to provoke an uproar, imagine the corrosive effect on political support for the Single European Act of additional competitive devaluations. [/p] [p]
More surprise realignments, the Bundesbank's preference, are not feasible when capital flows are unfettered.

The Southwark Court of Requests was still functioning, and the process there was initiated by a tradesman or individual lodging a complaint against another for non-payment of money owed, after less formal requests had been ignored.

If he was suing for less than 20s in 1830 he left a deposit of 5s; 7s 6d for one between 20s and 40s; 10s between 40s and 60s, and 12s 6d for 60s.

More hours did generally mean more advertising revenue for ITV, and the companies frequently pressed the government for expansion.
In 1972 restrictions were lifted.
ITV and BBC1 were both soon broadcasting some 13 hours a day (the main change being an extension of afternoon hours) &mdash; double the amount 20 years earlier.
Breakfast time TV and Channel 4 doubled them again, so that by the late 1980s each network was putting out 200 hours a week.
Viewers thus went from a choice of less than 30 hours a week in 1946 to more than 400 in the late 1980s.

The first four of these had mainly family farms and the pattern was understandable but the Wester Ross response was more difficult to explain. [/p] [p]
For most of the farmers time off would have to be taken, either as holiday or unpaid leave.
Their willingness to do so indicated a strong desire to participate in training.
Wives also chose afternoons: the bulk of the outside work and the housework being finished they could attend knowing they would arrive home in time for the children returning from school. [/p] [p]

Slightly later came heavyweight Peter Jackson, born in St Croix, West Indies, in 1861, four years before emancipation.
He travelled as a seaman to Sydney where he won the Australian heavyweight title before transferring to San Francisco where he was persuaded by the Earl of Lonsdale to operate in England, a move which enhanced his status greatly, as a contemporary noted: &bquo;I knew him in the <head>days</head> of his greatness when sitting on top of the pugilistic world, f&ecirc;ted and lionized, he might well have been excused some slight vanity&equo; (quoted by Henderson, 1949, pp.20&ndash;1).

There was something about the movies although not too many people stopped to ask what it was.
Analysis only came later.
It was in 1927 for example that Kenneth Macpherson speculated whether those early film audiences had not just been distracted and drawn mindlessly from the streets but rather it might have been a case of &bquo;the people getting in some dim way the fact that there was something under their eyes, a sense of life and expectancy&equo;.

The centralised technical control, exercised by the chief engineer's department at headquarters, meant that the men who had accepted these posts were to find their room for independent and creative action significantly more constrained than was the case for their colleagues in the Area Boards.
The extent to which management powers over generation were devolved depended on the central triumvirate of Citrine, Self and Hacking, and not on a statutorily entrenched position.

[hi]Voluntary unemployment can be defined as consisting of all those persons who are not in paid employment and are receiving some form of social security benefit, but are not actually seeking jobs at the prevailing rate of real wages [/hi].
This includes those who are temporarily between jobs and drawing unemployment benefit to tide them over until the new job is taken up.
It also includes those who prefer to remain unemployed, believing that their incomes from social security benefits do not make it worthwhile to take up a job. [/p] [p]

For example, it can be stated that &bquo;By the end of the ward allocation the student will be able to catheterise a female patient, using an aseptic and atraumatic [pb] technique&equo;, or &bquo;By the end of the ward allocation the student will be able to identify five potential problems associated with catheterization&equo;.
These guidelines for learning should be given to the student at the beginning of her time on the ward.
More precise objectives for individual teaching and tutorials should also be listed.
These are of particular value when a student misses a session.
She is then able to cover the same ground, using the objectives set by the ward. [/p] [p]
The length of the whole learning programme must be determined.
If students are allocated to the ward for eight-week periods, it is sensible to have a rotating cycle of an eight-week programme.
The content of the programme should follow a logical sequence.
In practice, the student will necessarily miss some continuity because of <head>days</head> off and night duty.

And these were the conditions under which [hi]Screwtape [/hi] and indeed all his books were produced. [/p] [p]
How, it may be asked, could any serious work be done in those circumstances?
The answer is that in the years when Minto was in her fall vigour, Lewis's flow of words was limited.
A glance at the shelf containing his long list of books shows us immediately that the bulk of his work was completed when Minto was in her dotage or after she died.
He was a fluent and rapid prose writer.
But his first major prose work &mdash; [hi]The Allegory of Love &mdash; [/hi] took about eight years to complete.
This was the price he paid far having thrown in his lot with a person who with all her virtues &mdash; generosity, warmth of character, genuine and passionate admiration, as well as love, for Lewis himself &mdash; did not have the concept of a working <head>day</head> .

Of course, there were sell programs in past years, too, but they seem to
hurt market makers more painfully these days.  That's largely because of
defensive measures they adopted after the 1987 crash, when individual
investors fled the market and trading activity dwindled.  Market makers, to
cut costs, slashed inventories of stocks they keep on hand to sell
investors when other holders are n't selling.  And to protect their reduced
capital investment from eroding further, market makers became quicker to
lower price quotes when sell programs are in progress.  On days when prices
are tumbling, they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one
else will.  In such an environment, market makers can suffer huge losses
both on trades made that <head>day</head> at steadily dropping prices
and in the value of their inventories of shares.

Several big securities firms backed off from program trading a few months
after the 1987 crash.  But most of them, led by Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., moved
back in earlier this year.  The most volatile form of program trading is
index arbitrage -- the rapid-fire, computer-guided buying and selling of
stocks offset with opposite trades in stock-index futures and options.  The
object is to capture profits from fleeting price discrepancies between the
futures and options and the stocks themselves.  Index arbitrage recently

The size of IBM's issue was increased from an originally planned $500
million as money managers and investors scrambled to buy the bonds.  In the

And important U.S. lawmakers must decide at the end of November if the
Contras are to receive the rest of the $49 million in so-called
humanitarian assistance under a bipartisan agreement reached with the Bush
administration in March.  The humanitarian assistance, which pays for
supplies such as food and clothing for the rebels amassed along the
Nicaraguan border with Honduras, replaced the military aid cut off by
Congress in February 1988.  While few lawmakers anticipated that the
humanitarian aid would be cut off next month, Mr. Ortega's threat
practically guarantees that the humanitarian aid will be continued.  Senate
Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.) said yesterday on ``Meet the Press'':
``I would hope after his -LCB- Mr. Ortega's -RCB- act yesterday or the
<head>day</head> before, we 'd have unanimous support for quick
action on remaining humanitarian aid.''
